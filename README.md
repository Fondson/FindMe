# Find Me
Demo made during ConUHacks 2016

# Description
This Android app was made using the Clarifai image recognition API as a basis. Find Me is a game where the API takes in a random image and the tags associated with the random image are displayed along with a selection of images. Simply guess which picture corresponds to the tags generated by Clarifai.
